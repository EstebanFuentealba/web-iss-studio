# Web ISS Studio (WIP üöß)

Web ISS Studio is a Graphical Web User Interface to create your own game based on International Superstar Soccer for Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES).

## ‚ú® Features

You can edit:

- Players (name, shirt number, hair and skin color, normal or special, hairstyle)
- Hair and skin colors (normal players, special players and goalkeepers)
- Team names (positional text and tile images under the flag)
- Flag (design and colors)
- Uniform (kit) colors (for outfield players, first and second kits, and goalkeepers)

## üìù Notes
- Works well with original ROM International Superstar Soccer (Europe), and ROMs based on it.
- When you save the design of a flag or a team name tile based image, team name tiled images are moved to the address 0x17680, so that you will have additional space to create more flags than the original game (from 0x48000 to 0x48A7F)

**Addresses used by editor** (you will recieve an error in order to protect your ROM if data overtake these addresses)

0x48000 to 0x48A7F - Flag design tile images
0x17680 to 0x17FFF - Team name tile images (automatically moved to this address)
0x43ED5 to 0x44486 - Team name positional text data
